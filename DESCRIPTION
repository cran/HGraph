Title: Use Graph Structure to Travel
Version: 0.1.0

Description: It is used to travel graphs, by using DFS and BFS to get the path from node to each leaf node.
  Depth first traversal(DFS) is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.
  Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph.
  Breadth first traversal(BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria.
  It starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
  Also, it provides the matrix which is reachable between each node.
